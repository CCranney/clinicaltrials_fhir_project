However, if it is determined after initial accrual of patients in this upper age range that this procedure is relatively safe, the age range may be extended.|No physical contraindications to stem cell donation (i.e. severe atherosclerosis, auto-immune disease, cerebrovascular accident, prior malignancy. Patients with severe atherosclerosis by history will receive a cardiology consult and be judged eligible on a case by case basis. The exclusion of patients with a prior malignancy will be evaluated on a case by case basis. If it is felt by the investigators that the risk of potential transfer of malignant cells is far outweighed by the potential benefit of the procedure the patient may be eligible to serve as a donor. Persons with a history of non-hematologic malignancy must have undergone potentially curative therapy for that malignancy and 1) have had no evidence of that disease for 5 years, and/or 2) be deemed at low risk for recurrence (less than or equal to 20% at 5 years). Such persons will be considered eligible for stem cell donation at the discretion of the principal investigator, who will evaluate the possible benefit to the potential transplant recipient and the risk of disease transmission in consultation with Department of Transfusion Medicine staff. Prospective donors with a history of non-hematologic malignancy who have received potentially curative therapy and are in remission, but whose estimated risk of recurrence is greater than 20% at 5 years, will be considered on an individual basis in consultation with the NCI IRB. Any prospective transplant recipient whose donor has a history of malignancy will be counseled about the theoretical risk of transmission of cancer from the donor to the recipient.|Donors must be HIV-negative, HbsAg, and Hepatitis C antibody negative. As donors are providing an allogeneic blood product there is the potential risk of transmitting these viral illnesses to the recipient.|Donor must not be pregnant or breastfeeding an infant. A donor who is lactating must substitute formula feeding for her infant during the period of cytokine administration. Filgrastim may be secreted in human milk, although its bioavailability from this source is not known. Limited clinical data suggest that short-term administration of filgrastim or sargramostim to neonates is not associated with adverse outcomes. Donors of childbearing potential must use an effective method of contraception during the time they are receiving cytokines. The effects of cytokine administration on a fetus are unknown and may be potentially harmful. The effects upon breast milk are also unknown and may potentially be harmful to the infant.|Ability to give informed consent.||EXCLUSION CRITERIA:||Exclusion Criteria - Patient||Active infection that is not responding to antimicrobial therapy.|History of psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with transplant protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent (as determined by principal investigator).||Exclusion Criteria - Donor||History of psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with transplant protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent.|History of hypertension that is not controlled by medication, stroke, or severe heart disease.
