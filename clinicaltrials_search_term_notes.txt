CONDITION:
Specific conditions they have, separated by "OR" keyword

OVERALLSTATUS:
"NOT completed AND NOT active" should always be part of the search. You may want to print the output in order of other statuses, like recruiting.

GENDER:
given gender and "All" should be options.

HEALTHYVOLUNTEERS:
probably means co-morbidity, but unknown. Possibly exclude, or include in the final output but not part of the search criteria.

//The above should be broad, catch-all terms to get an initial list of studies. Everything after will require some coding.

MINIMUMAGE:
Seems to always be in a "__ Years" format. Can extract via regular expression.

MAXIMUMAGE:
Same as MINIMUMAGE, though this can be omitted in the results. Use them to create a range (no upper bound if MAXIMUMAGE not present) that can be matched to survey results.

ELIGIBILITYCRITERIA:
Split into "Inclusion Criteria:||" and "||Exclusion Criteria:||" sections. This will be the most variable, but will probably be most used for the exclusion bit.
